# test/runtests.jl — canonical Julia test entry for BennettVM.jl.
#
# Per CLAUDE.md Rule 4 ("'Runs without errors' is not a passing test"),
# every included file must assert against known-correct values, not just
# "didn't throw". Per Rule 7, the entire suite runs in a single Julia
# process — no parallelism between test files.
#
# Currently only the M0.3 Handoff-A smoke is wired up. M0.4 will add the
# remaining motivating-case smokes (fdict, frtN, matrix_sum) once their
# Bennett.jl `ParsedIR`s are nailed down for the ADR.
